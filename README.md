# User Guide for PSRVLBIREDUCE

Overview of this repository
This project provides a pipeline for VLBI data reduction, with special focus on VLBI astrometry. The main data reduction code, written in python-based parseltongue (Kettenis et al. 2006), is vlbi_astrometry.py which calls classes and functions from vlbireduce.py and support_vlbireduce.py. The latter two use functions provided in vlbatasks.py, where some new features have also been added. The pipeline was originally developed and used by Dr. Deller for the PSRPI project (Deller et al. 2019) and other projects. Since 2018, it has undergone large upgrades (including systematic restructuring) made by Hao Ding. Currently, the vlbireduce_v3 branch is already compatible with python3, and will be merged to the main branch after being tested properly.

New Feature of this branch: This branch is now compatible with python3, and will be merged to master after being tested.
   
Should you have any inquiry about the pipeline or comments for improvements, feel free to contact Hao (hdingastro@hotmail.com) or Adam (adeller@astro.swin.edu.au).

## Required Packages and Software for PSRVLBIReduce: AIPS and PARSELTONGUE
To successfully run PSRVLBIREDUCE, you will need to have both AIPs and PARSELTONGUE installed on the machine on which you plan on running the software. For a detailed overview of how to download both of these software components, please see `install.md`. 

## Examples
To test out the pipeline and gain a basic understanding for how it works, there exists example .yaml files for an observation of PSR J1738+0333. Under `/examples`, there is a `README.md` which will walk you through the steps to get PSRVLBIREDUCE running on this dataset, and hence should serve as an example for how to run it on your own dataset.
