About psrvlbireduce:

This project provides pipeline for VLBI data reduction, with special focus on VLBI astrometry.
The main data reduction code, written in python-based parseltongue (Kettenis et al. 2006), is vlbi_astrometry.py calling classes and functions from vlbireduce.py and support_vlbireduce.py. The latter two use functions provided in vlbatasks.py, where some new features have also been added. The pipeline was originally developed and used by Dr. Deller for the PSRPI project (Deller et al. 2019) and other projects. Since 2018, it has undergone large upgrade (including systematic restructuring) made by Hao Ding. Currently, the package is written in python2, but is en route to being re-formatted to python3.

Should you have any inquiry about the pipeline or comments for improvements, feel free to contact Hao (hdingastro@hotmail.com) or Adam (adeller@gmail.com).
