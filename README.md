About psrvlbireduce:
This project provides pipeline for VLBI data reduction, with special focus on VLBI astrometry.
The main data reduction code, written in python-based parseltongue (Kettenis et al. 2006), is vlbi_astrometry_reduce.py calling classes and functions from vlbireduce.py, support_vlbireduce.py and vlbatasks.py. Some new functions or classes are being added to vlbatasks.py for new features. 
The pipeline has been developed and used by Dr. Deller for the PSRPI project (Deller et al. 2019), and has gone through large upgrade (including systematic restructuring) since 2018 made by Hao Ding. Currently, vlbireduce_v2 is the latest branch in continuous maintainance and development. v2 will be merged to the master branch by mid-2022.

Should you have any inquiry about the pipeline or comments for improvements, feel free to contact haoding@swin.edu.au or adeller@gmail.com.
