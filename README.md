About psrvlbireduce:
This project provides pipeline for VLBI data reduction, with special focus on VLBI astrometry.
The main data reduction code, written in python-based parseltongue (Kettenis et al. 2006), is (temporally called) final_astrometric_reduce.py calling functions from vlbatasks.py. Some new functions or classes are being added to vlbatasks.py for new features. 
The pipeline has been developed and used by Dr. Deller for the PSRPI project (Deller et al. 2019). Though well tested, the pipeline still calls for heavy tidy-up and enhancement before being released.

Timeline:
The project will be released by the end of 2022.

For any inquiry about the pipeline, feel free to contact haoding@swin.edu.au.
