# psrvlbireduce
The main data reduction code is final_astrometric_reduce.py calling functions from vlbatasks.py.
Some new functions or classes are being added to vlbatasks.py for various purposes. The pipeline is well tested while is still going through some improvement. It will be released at some point.
For any inquiry about the pipeline, feel free to contact haoding@swin.edu.au.
